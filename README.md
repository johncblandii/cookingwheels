Code Notes
----------

* Private access functions all start with $
* Data variables passed to views start with $

Route Notes
-----------

* There are some specific routes purely for customization of the url's

Layout Notes
-------------

* Partials are used for repeat view code
* The layout has more code output than desired. Typically I'd separate the layout into extra partials a bit more.
